## ‚úÖ Best Practices to Follow

To ensure high-quality projects, we recommend adhering to the following best practices:

1. **Gitflow:** Always use pull requests (PRs) for introducing new features or changes. This helps in maintaining a clean commit history and enables peer reviews.
2. **Commit Formatting:** Follow a commit convention such as Git convention or [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). It makes the commit history readable and easy to understand.
3. **Test Coverage:** Aim for a minimum test coverage of 80-90%. This ensures that the majority of your code is tested, reducing potential bugs and regressions.
4. **Comprehensive README:** A well-documented README provides clarity about the project's purpose, usage, and maintenance.
5. **Live Demo:** Always provide a live demo with login credentials (if applicable). It offers a hands-on experience of your application to users or potential employers.
6. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Implement CI to automatically build and test your project. This ensures that your code is always in a deployable state.
7. **Continuous Deployment (CD):** While CI is a must, having CD is a nice-to-have feature. It automates the deployment process, ensuring that the latest changes are instantly accessible to users.
8. **Clean Code:** Avoid clutter or "junk" in your code. Ensure that your codebase is organized, commented when necessary, and follows established coding standards.
